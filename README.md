# Compiler Adventure

Contains Compiler/Interpeter stuff to learn.

JLox is half-done because i came to the conclusion that a Tree-Walker Interpreter stinks and not fun to work at. Also the code kind of got out of hand. And i don't want to fix on it considering i didn't like any of it anyway. :)

RLox is half finished, don't even dare open it >:(
